# BCE - autonomous racing car

This is the repository for the code of the bce car. The project started as a school project with the aim of converting and programming an RC car as an autonomous racing car. The car was modeled and planned in a CAD program. The main computer is a Raspberry Pi, which communicates with the other controllers, two Arduino Pro Minis are used for this. The motor driver, a servo and several sensors are connected to the Arduinos. The Arduinos communicate with the Raspberry Pi via the I2C bus.
